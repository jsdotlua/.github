# `ðŸ“¦ JS.Lua`

**Community-maintained JavaScript packages, translated to Lua.** 

</div>

Most packages in this repository stem from Roblox's work translating common JavaScript packages to [Luau](https://luau-lang.org). This project aims to keep Roblox's translated packages maintained in the open for all to use. Most packages maintained here are largely runtime-agnostic and can run in any environment (with some elbow grease). They aren't just tied to Roblox!

All packages in this org were originally licensed under MIT and remain under the same license today.
